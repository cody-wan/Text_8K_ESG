## Downside

Matching keywords is likely to give more positive results than desired. For instance, with a keyword of `weather`, companies in the agriculture, oil and other industries suscesptable to weather conditions may easily contain this keyword, while not expressing views that blame the underperformance to bad, e.g. [ROCHE HOLDINGS, INC. and SPARK THERAPEUTICS's merger](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609351/000119312519048943/d711494dex21.htm).
