# MathFin_Project_20Fall


This repository contains the code for my master's project [Text Analysis on Corporate 8K Filings: Sustainability as a Trading Signal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lvyt2nsVKrjSj9lJnzi9J7QXkYm84-aL/view?usp=sharing). The development process started from a series of jupyter notebook scripts, in the same alphabetical order as the notebook (ipynb) files listed above. Functionalities that have been finalized are abstracted away as functions and stored in `utils` repository.

## archive

This repository contains currently not needed but previously used files.

## backtests

This repository contains backtest results.

## data

This repository contains some small-to-medium sized data, such as database linking table, filtered stock list etc. Larger data are stored locally (e.g. scraped filing texts) or to be referenced via SQL on the spot (e.g. price history from crsp).

## images

This repository contains image files used in other files, mostly notes.

## logs

This repository contains a collection of text files that detail some long-running function's status, interim output, errors (e.g. scraping a few hundreds of stock's 8-K files takes about 48 hours). Useful for debugging and optimization.

## notes

This repository contains study notes, general findings and implementation pitfalls that I've discovered, with on-going update.

## reference

This repository contains articles and journal papers possibly relevant to this project.

## utils

This repository contains helper functions. 

## web_scraping

This repository contains a complete implementation of scrapy-based web scraper.
